        <h2>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h2>
      	  <p>
        	  DBC has a large emphasis on culture, empathy, and being mindful of everyone's ability level. 
          	It provides an opportunity to teach as well as to learn.

        <h2>Driver vs. Navigator</h2>
        	<p>
          	The driver is the typer and the navigator provides typing instructions to the driver.
          	The navigator provides an extra set of eyes for error-checking.

      			This actually wasn't my first time pairing! I had paired earlier on the Wireframing challenge. Both times, however, it was great. It was excellent to have someone to bounce ideas off of and to hear someone else's coding process. It definitely made the coding easier. I liked it a lot.
