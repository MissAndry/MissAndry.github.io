		<h1>NEW BLOG LAYOUT</h1>
	</header>
	
	<p>I want a website with: </p><ul>
		<li>the navigation bar at the same level as the header, like the "Women in Computing" website, and I want at least some of those links to "jump" to different parts of the page. </li>
		<li>a center column for most of the content</li>
		<li>responsivity - the header and nav bar centered at around 600px and no further apart than the content section at around 1200px</li>
		<li>picture links that respond to a small screen by turning into an easier-to-see column of banners</li>
		<li>different fonts! not, like, a ton, but a few good ones from Google Fonts instead of just 'Helvetica', 'Arial', 'Times'</li></ul>

	<p>Here are some wireframes:<br><br>
		<img src="images/large_screen.png" style="max-width: 650px;"/>
		<br><p>On a larger screen</p> 
		<img src="images/small_screen.png" style="max-width: 650px;"/>
		<br><p>On a smaller screen</p></p>
