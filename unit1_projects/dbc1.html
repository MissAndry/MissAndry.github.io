	<h2>why dbc?</h2>
	<p>Basically - why not? I like to code and I can do DBC, so why not try it? It's one of the best hacker programs around.<br>
		<br>
		A little under a year ago, I took a Python class through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. That gave a good, healthy taste of programming - frustration at a problem mixed with elation when it worked. After that, I sought tutorials and resources on my own, and have been working steadily with Ruby.</p>

		<li>Heat <b>tortilla</b> of choice. Place heated tortilla open-face on whatever counter space is available.</li>
		<li>Thickly slather some <b>guacamole</b> on there. Guac is an important first ingredient since it will hold everything else together.</li>
		<li><b>Rice</b>, if you want rice (you want rice. It's delicious and more importantly will soak up all the extra meat and bean juices).</li>
		<li><b>Meat</b>, if you're a meat eater.</li>
		<li><b>Cheese</b>, if you're a cheese eater. The cheese should melt into the meat and/or rice to give you all its gooey, greasy goodness.</li>
		<li><b>Beans</b>. These are delicious and will help melt the cheese further.</li>
		<li><b>Salsa</b>, if you're into that.</li>
