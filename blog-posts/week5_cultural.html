		<h2>Pairing && Feedback</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Pair-programming is an important part of DBc and tech in general. Before DBc, I hadn't 
			worked with anyone on my code who wasn't a pro - that was less "working on code" and "pro 
			coder helped me troubleshoot", so it hardly counts. After a few weeks working remotely, I 
			definitely prefer pair programming. It's incredibly helpful to brainstorm solutions, debug, 
			and write with someone else. 
		</p>
		<h3>Pairing</h3>
		<hr />
		<p> 
			Effective pair programming forces communication to the point of over-communicating - I find 
			myself saying, "Here's what I'm thinking..." or "My first thought is to..." a lot, followed 
			by, "...could that work?" or "...what do you think?" That structure opens up the 
			conversation and includes both people, even if one person is coming up with the majority of 
			ideas. I also noticed a mix of "talking to the rubber ducky" (during initial debugging) and 
			collaboration (during problem-solving). 
		</p>
		<p>
			Pair programming also forces you to abandon your set habits. I have a few methods that I 
			always try first when going solo, but that approach isn't totally possible in pair 
			programming. Pairing forces you to slow down and think about your process because you have 
			to explain it to someone else, and forces you to be open to new ideas because someone else 
			is describing their process to you. I have a really difficult time finding the words to 
			describe my process, but hopefully that'll get easier through reading and talking more.
		</p>
		<p>
			It also makes it easier to recognize and escape thought loops - that is, it's easier to recognize that you're coming back to the same incorrect solution when you're talking the process through with someone else. Since you're forced to recognize where you're getting caught, only good things can happen in this type of communication. When stuck on one part of a problem by myself, I'll need to take a long break to figure it out, but working through that same section with someone else takes less than half the time. It's somehow also harder to recognize that you're stuck when working by yourself - I always think "BUT THIS SHOULD WORK!" and want to give up when a piece of solo coding escapes me. Conversely, when I work with someone to find the answer, I'm suddenly a lot more patient.
		</p>
		<h3>Feedback</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Every time I load up the Socrates Feedback app to read new feedback, I get nervous. Even if the pairing session went well I tend to assume that the feedback will be negative. When looking at new feedback, I initially focus on the ratings, then read the paragraphs. The nerves are totally unfounded. It's a great gauge of how I'm fitting with other people. After reading feedback, I try to incorporate the actionable feedback into my next pairing session if I can. I also try to add more consideration to repeated notes - more than one person has said I could communicate more, so that's something I'm actively working on. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I always - always - try to figure out which of my pairs left feedback. Call it curiosity. I just want to know.
		</p>
		<p>
			Giving feedback can be difficult. How do you rate another person? How can you correctly assess where they are with the learning competencies; how do you give critical feedback without seeming harsh? Every time these questions come up, I find a different answer, leading to inconsistent reviews. Sometimes I come up with something actionable just because feedback is supposed to be actionable, not because I thought there was anything to improve. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, I think pair-programming is incredibly beneficial to code, and receiving feedback can be validating and motivating.
