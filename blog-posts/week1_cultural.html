			DBC seems like it's actively creating an environment that encourages empathy, curiosity, and rigor. Cohorts are expected to be supportive of each other and of their team, which is something I think I'd be great at as long as I feel that energy from of my fellow cohorts. My expectations haven't changed much - I thought it was going to be very rigorous, and that idea was solidified. The breadth of the engineering empathy program seems larger than I thought, though! It also seems like learning code languages aren't as important as learning a mindset and design concepts, and I'm not sure, anymore, if equal weight is given to front- and back-end development.

			Nonetheless, I am excited to learn with passionate, motivated people, even though the thought of constant communication and vulnerability makes me feel... well, nervous. This is a really big change, and I've got the impostor syndrome niggling around my brain. 
			<br><br>
			Either way, I'm mostly excited to make a mess in the kitchen with you all. Let's get cooking.
