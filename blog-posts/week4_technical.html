		<h2>Combination Station</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>
			<b>Array#combination</b> takes one argument (the number of things you'd like to combine at a time) and returns an Enumerator. <br>
			<img src="../unit1_projects/images/week-4/naked%20combination.png" />
			You can call conversions on an Enumerator. The most common of these is #to_a. That will give you an array containing arrays of the length specified by the argument. <br>
			<img src="../unit1_projects/images/week-4/combination%20with%20to_a.png" />
			Like pretty much everything in Ruby, you can save #combination's returned Enumerator into a variable, then call an array conversion on that variable. (You could also save a.combination(2).to_a into a variable, because Ruby doesn't discriminate.)<br>
			<img src="../unit1_projects/images/week-4/combination in a variable.png" />
			If you pass an argument to #combination that is higher than the array's length, it will return an empty array (once #to_a is called) because there are no combinations of that length. Likewise, if you pass an argument of 0, it will return an array housing an empty array. 
			<img src="../unit1_projects/images/week-4/too many combinations.png" />
			<img src="../unit1_projects/images/week-4/no combinations.png" />
			#combination.to_a might be most useful when you need to create unique groups, like in the accountability group creator challenge this week.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Array#combination</b>'s sister is <b>Array#permutation</b>. #permutation, like #combination, returns an Enumerator when called without a converter, and an array of permutated arrays when called with #to_a. <br>
			<img src="../unit1_projects/images/week-4/permutation to_a.png" />
			The biggest difference between #combination and #permutation is #permutation doesn't ignore matching pairs.As you can see, #permutation here returns twice the number of arrays as #combination. Some of the arrays have matching values. #combination would treat [1,2] and [2,1] as redundant, but #permutation doesn't hate that hard. It finds uniqueness in the value positon rather than the actual value. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When faced with arguments higher than the array's length or equaling zero, #permutation reacts exactly the same way as #combination. <br>
			<img src="../unit1_projects/images/week-4/too many permutations.png" />
			<img src="../unit1_projects/images/week-4/no permutations.png" />
			Those both contain no elements because:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>There can be no permutations that are longer than the array's length</li>
			<li>There can be only one permutation of a zero length (otherwise known as an empty array)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			#permutation.to_a is most useful when you need to prioritize element position over the element's existence.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also call #to_h, creating a hash.<br>
			<img src="../unit1_projects/images/week-4/combine and permeate hashes.png" />
			#combination and #permutation are less useful when converting to a hash. They can only be called with an argument of 2 and return less combinations and permutations than the array. There may be some good uses for a hash created this way, but they escape me!
		</p>
		<p>
			Maybe later versions of Ruby will automatically return an array when #combination and #permutation are used, but for now, don't forget to use #to_a!
