		<h2>Accomplished Relations</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>
			I'm happiest about and proudest of individual accomplishments and cultivating close relationships. There's a tangibility to both of those concepts. With an accomplishment, I can point to the finished result and say, "I did that thing, there it is, isn't it great?" (Accomplishments can include baking a loaf of bread.) With close relationships, it's (thankfully) possible to assess that my friends like me (does this relationship make me feel good? If so, great. If not, why keep it alive?).
		</p>
		<p>
			Talking about my this oddly makes me self-conscious. I've never really thought about what my core set of beliefs is (besides, you know, "be good to people"). I don't want to misrepresent myself but I'm also not sure what honestly representing myself would be. Thinking about my accomplishments and close relationships feels great, though. Those are things that I've consciously worked towards and built, and - as corny as this sounds - they give me as much as I give them. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite those being some of my valued traits, I'm not sure that "accomplishments" and "close relationships" will immediately quell stereotype threat when I feel it. Stereotype threat can really throw me off my game when it happens; I usually need the space of a day or so to remind myself that I'm great. Honestly, having to keep constant reminders of my accomplishments just to offset stereotype threat sounds very exhausting. I wouldn't want that to manifest in a braggy, self-important sort of way, either. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Luckily, I really enjoy coding. That enjoyment is likely to help me rise above the threat. I can only hope my friends can and will give me advice on how to avoid being the other end of stereotype threat.
		</p>
		<p>
			Being away from my friends is something I'm worried about. I'm also worried that moving to a new city, halfway across the country, will pop me into an unshakeable blue funk that has nothing to do with coding or DBC. (Staying in Berkeley is also likely to trigger a blue funk.) If I'm just doing badly on a coding problem, I can take a break and give myself a pep talk about how I'm smarter than a computer, but just missing people... that's harder to talk yourself out of. But there's always phones and the Internet, so it's not as though my friends will really be that far away. Being active (e.g. going dancing) or active-minded (e.g. actively creating a meal) also helps. And anyway, there'll be a new city to explore and new people to meet. It'll be an adventure, and it's hard to stay blue during an adventure.
