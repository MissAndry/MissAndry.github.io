		<h2>NO. CONCRETE. 'TIL BROOKLYYYYYN.</h2>
		<hr />

			According to the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">Gregorc Thinking Style</a>, I'm a concrete sequential thinker. Always have been, won't always be. I learn best in a methodical, structured way. The best way to use this at DBc is to do all the readings, then start the problems. In order. Slowly. Methodically. With great joy. But there's not always time for that.
		</p>

			My biggest problem, so far, has been generating content and design simultaneously. (Getting impatient is a close second.) This aversion to open-ended problems is typical of Concrete Sequential thinkers. It's not that I don't have the imagination to tackle the problem, it's more that it's difficult to visualize and steadily work towards a goal when I have to come up with all the steps in between. Somehow, a mental block forms when I think there's a goal but no directions for getting there. Left aimless, I'll happily explore; given a task, I'll happily complete it; but given a goal with an aimless approach leaves me with a mixture of fear, boredom, and annoyance. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I want to work on breaking out of that mindset and tapping into a journey rather than fixating on a destination. For that, I need to allow myself more time in the sandbox, learning and playing with code components. It's useless to be afraid of the unkown, of creation, for fear of it being "wrong." That kind of fear can lead to thought-ruts, and those ruts inhibit growth. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Looking at other people's code for different solutions to synthesize together or finding pretty websites for design inspiration might help me start to visualize the process a bit better. Bouncing ideas around with my cohort mates also helps creative growth - don't hesitate to reach out!
