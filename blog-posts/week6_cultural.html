		<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
		<img src="../unit1_projects/images/GROSS-susie-pushback.gif" />
		<hr />
		<p>
			STEREOTYPE THREAT: The fear of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype and/or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm the negative stereotype. Mis-representing yourself and the group to which a part of your identity is closely tied. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Social identity can refer to anything that identifies you - ethnicity, age, economic status, gender, sexuality, etc. - in a social setting. You can cultivate that identity (i.e. "I identify as a girl, and to express that identity I will wear a traditionally feminine dress") or someone can paste it on you (i.e. "Your skin is ridiculously pale so you are white").
		</p>
		<p>
			Stereotypes frustrate me so much because I know, intellectually, that (as a woman) I am not stupid, slatternly, flighty, or weak, but I also know believe other people might judge me that way without getting to know me. Being a girl gave affords me more opportunities to explore certain hobbies, like baking, knitting, and dancing ballet. Just as my female-ness offered me those hobbies, it gives me discouragement around pursuing math (when I told my dad I wanted to take a math class, he responded, "Why?"), learning about cars, or starting up the grill when my family has a cookout. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Early on in freshman year of college, I met more than a few people pursuing computer science. What they were doing with their computers seemed so cool and mysterious. I wanted to know what they were doing, so I asked. When I didn't understand, I asked more questions. More often than not, the response I got was a variation on, "It's really difficult and complicated" with a dose of "You wouldn't understand" thrown in for good measure. It's hard to blame those guys. They were learning about Computer Science, not professors trying to convert a student. Nevertheless, their attitude gave the impression that CS was a boys' club (no girls allowed) and reinforced the well-known stereotype that women aren't cut out for STEM fields.
		</p>
		<p>
			Further expressing a desire to learn programming, I started soliciting people for advice on where to start. Some people told me about Python, but the words that stuck were, "Programming is really hard. Why do you want to learn that?" Those words gave me the idea that because something is "hard," I shouldn't attempt it and probably won't be good at it. Whether or not this has to do with me being female-bodied or not is a mystery, but it again reinforces a theme that runs rampant through our culture - women aren't supposed to do things that are "hard." Since being a woman is a core part of my identity. When I think I'm fulfilling a negative stereotype about that identity (I can't solve a hard math problem, so I'm reflecting that women are bad at math), it feels horrible. Chest-tightening anxiety can be difficult to work through, and it's more difficult to believe that you're good at a task when you underperform.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, the motivation to destroy that stereotype can also fuel its fulfillment. In his studies on the subject of stereotype threat, Dr. Claude Steele learned that when people are faced with a negative stereotype about their group, they are <a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/">more likely to fulfill it</a>.
		</p>
		<p> 
			In his study, Steele found that people are more likely to underperform when the task is linked with a negative stereotype about their group that is linked. For example[link], when a group of black and white students are given a test and told that that it will measure their intelligence, the black students tend to underperform (thereby supporting the racist stereotype that black people are less intelligent than white). When another group of black and white students are given the same test but are told that it's "just a puzzle" with no bearing on their intellectual capacity, black students perform equally as well as the white students (thereby proving the racist stereotype wrong). Steele's explanation is that black students, when explicitly faced with the threat of affirming the stereotype, become intensely focused on destroying the stereotype - which steals cognitive ability from performing well on the test. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This reaction to stereotype threat is also supported in other and more subtle cases - for instance, women golfers completed a golf test with a male reviewer and <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_stone_mcwhinnie.html">performed worse</a> than when they were tested with a female reviewer, and black students <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_marx_goff.html">performed worse</a> on an oral exam when the examiner was white than when the examiner was black. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The subtle indication that the stereotype might be present - a black student might expect that a white examiner will draw a conclusion about black students based on their solo performance - is as stressful as the explicit clarification that the stereotype is there. This effect can be amplified when someone who is nonwhite and non-male <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_sekaquaptewa_waldman_thompson.html">is</a> or <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_murphy_steele_gross.html">expects to be</a> the minority in a white, male-centric group. Consider this report from <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/">the Atlantic</a>: 
		</p>
			<blockquote>
				"...for African-American students generally, negative stereotypes apply in many situations, even personal ones. Why was that old roommate unfriendly to him? Did that young white woman who has been so nice to him in class not return his phone call because she's afraid he'll ask her for a date? Is it because of his race or something else about him? He cannot know the answers, but neither can his rational self fully dismiss the questions. Together they raise a deeper question: Will his race be a boundary to his experience, to his emotions, to his relationships?" 
			</blockquote>	
		<p>
			That circular questioning can be a constant, subconscious backdrop to someone's daily life leads to constantly checking that you're doing okay, that you're good, that you're earning respect. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of emotional effort and ultimately inhibits performance. 
		</p>
		<p>
			So how do we combat the threat?
		</p>
		<p>
			In my ideal, every type of person is represented in companies, in media, in any gathering. I'd love it if everyone supported each other and all stereotypes were good because we're all part of the same big happy human family, but I know that's a big goal and tremendously far away (if it'll ever be reached). So, baby steps.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fortunately, there's a flip side to the <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_murphy_steele_gross.html">"implied minority" experiment</a>: people who watched a gender-balanced video of a conference expressed more interest in attending the conference than people who watched a video that advertised the conference with more male than female attendants. This seems an easy enough solution - to combat stereotype threat, implement practices to ensure representative equality. That way, individuals will feel less pressured to destroy the negative stereotypes about their entire social group (whichever identity is most apparent at the time) - they're not alone, so one person's behavior can't confirm a sweeping negative stereotype. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Another solution would be to emphasize, at the beginning of whatever exercise is happening, that the results of the exercise have no bearing on ranking an ability. Instead, the exercise is just for the exercise's sake.
		</p>
		<p>
			Will being actively inclusive solve all of the stereotype problems existent in society? No. Of course not. But it's a good place to start.
