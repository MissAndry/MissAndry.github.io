		<h2>Javascript: Hot or Not?</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>
			If you're like me, you took one look at a typical JavaScript file before quailing under curly braces and semicolons. It looks difficult to type. Even with a cursory knowledge of programming languages, it's hard to read. We're all going to have to get over that, though, because JavaScript is one of the most popular languages for web development.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Why JavaScript?</h3> 
		<p>
			Curly braces aside, JavaScript is read by all browsers - it's universal. With AJAX, JavaScript can work on both server and client sides - it's versatile. Since CSS and HTML are also pretty universal, JS, CSS, and HTML are basically the "three sisters" of web design. When you use HTML, CSS, and JS together, you'll have a powerful webpage with virtually no communication problems. This makes it incredibly easy to use when writing a web page.
		</p>
	
		<h3>JS Greatest Hits</h3>
		
			<ul>
				<li>It allows for object-oriented development, and objects can be designed and developed on the fly with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)<ul>
					<li>JSON is a data-interchange format built on unordered name/value pairs or an ordered list of values.</li></ul></li>
				<li>It is easy to debug because of the plethora of developer tools available</li>
				<li>With <a href="https://code.google.com/p/v8/" target="_blank">Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine</a>, JS doesn't have to load everything sequentially - with this engine, JS can process more than one task simultaneously</li>
				<li>It communitcates well with the server and works more quickly for the end user</li>
				<li>It is reponsive and interactive in creating HTML files</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3>JS Worst</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Incredibly dependent on AJAX for server-side script - it can't access databases or the server without AJAX, in fact!</li>
			<li>JS also can't read from or write files to the client because, other than cookies, it's not allowed to access anything outside the webpage on which it's running.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The pros of using JavaScript definitely outweigh the cons, and I'm excited to dive in further!
