		<h2>Emotional Conflict</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>
			My friend has a crush. She saw me talking to her crush - Isaac<sup>*</sup>, a close friend of mine - and got angry. She thought I was flirting, even though she had "dibs". All week, she snubs me whenever we cross paths, and I only know she's angry because a mutual friend clues me in. Our mutual friends take her lead, too, and also begin snubbing me. I start hearing a lot of criticism about my friendship with this boy. I insist to everyone that I wasn't flirting and am met with scoffs and disbelief. It sounds very middle school, but that's because it <i>was</i> middle school. 
		</p>
		<p>
			At first, I did feel ashamed. I didn't know what I was doing wrong in my friendship with Isaac. I started to cut him out of my life more and more. Eventually, it got to the point where I was barely even saying, "Hello," to him. Somehow, it still wasn't enough for my friend. I was still excluded.
		</p>
		<p>
			This fits in pretty well to the "Withdrawal" pointer on the <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">Compass of Shame</a>. When I asked my friends what I had done wrong, the answer was always the same: "You flirted." I thought that I must be the most in the wrong and drew away from the percieved source of the conflict. It ended up not helping at all. My friends were still mad at me for flirting with someone else's crush. Time passed, we got over or forgot about it, but it certainly isn't the ideal outcome - it only taught me that people are always going to talk, no matter what you do.
		</p>
		<p>
			If I could go back, knowing what I know now, I would definitely act differently. For one, I would outright apologize to my friend instead of trying to get "everyone" to be on my "side". If you're thinking that I'd apologize for something I didn't do, well, you're wrong. I'd apologize for making her uncomfortable with the way I had acted, and tell her that - from my end - it wasn't flirtatious, but people interpret things different ways and I could understand if she thought something was amiss, then ask if there was something specific that I had done. (More specific than "flirted.") Basically, I'd try to explicitly open direct lines of communication and give her the opportunity to tell me what was bothering her without dismissing her feelings. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Emotions are such a tricky thing to work around. They're always present but not always easy to identify. However, it's imperative to identify and communicate which emotions are present in any conflict in order to come to a resolution.
