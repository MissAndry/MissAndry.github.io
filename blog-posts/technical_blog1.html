			Wondaland.com</a><br><br>
			Wondaland.com is the web home of everything to do with Janelle Monae (plus some very thoughtful and thought-provoking articles). As an avid Monae appreciator, I like keeping up with her projects. <br><br> The site is topped with a newsreel graphic, which automatically scrolls left through four of the site's top stories. This is large enough that it commands attention at any distance. It immediately calls attention to new content, making it the most important part of the site.<br><br>Overall, the site is:</p><ul>
			<li>organized</li>
				<li>image-heavy</li>
				<li>funky</li>
				<li>crisp</li>
				<li>aesthetically pleasing</li>
			</ul><p class="main">Wondaland doesn't really solve any problems besides the problem of not knowing what Janelle Monae's friends are working on. Most of the content includes something about music, race, science fiction, queerness, feminism, or any combination of the above. The content is either purely commercial or an opinion, and the opinions are usually thoughtful, yet informal, takes on serious issues. Given the images, I would expect most of those topics.<br><br>
			From the homepage, it's easy to navigate to different pages, but it's not easy to find specific posts. The site isn't updated often, so there's a lot of missing information. The blog doesn't have an archive, but if you know what you're looking for, you can always search for it with the search bar. 
			<br><br>After a while, I feel motivated to find more music by the artists! The site doesn't directly sell anything.<br><br>

			<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank"><img src="../unit1_projects/images/wikipedia.png"><br>
			Wikipedia.org</a><br><br>
			I like Wikipedia because it's so informative. I use it all the time to get a basic understanding of many topics. When past the language page, my eye is immediately drawn to the "Featured Article." If I'm not right in front of the screen, however, I more notice that there are two, differently-colored columns prominently featured in the window.<br><br>Overall, this site is:</p><ul>
			<li>text-heavy</li>
			<li>well organized</li>
			<li>clean</li>
			<li>light</li>
			<li>dense</li>
			</ul><p class="main">Wikipedia solves the problem of owning many obsolete encyclopaedic volumes. It has articles on every topic you could imagine, from conspiracy theories regarding the longevity of a certain Beatle to the history and context of the Prussian war. No matter if the content is serious or funny, the delivery is always academic and (mostly) non-biased, making Wikipedia one of the most practical sites on the Web - which is pretty much what I would expect from the presentation! <br><br> If you know what you're looking for, it's extremely easy to find it using the search bar that appears on every page. After a while on Wikipeda, I start to feel tired and thoughtful, like I should go on a walk. The site doesn't sell anything but it does sometimes ask for donations. <br><br>
			<a href="http://www.comixology.com" target="_blank"><img src="../unit1_projects/images/comixology.png"><br>comiXology.com</a><br><br>
			I like comiXology because I like comic books, and this has got them all. Of course, I like supporting my local comic book store too, but sometimes I miss issues and have to get them on comiXology instead. When on the homepage, whether near the screen or far from it, my eye is first drawn to the banner of featured content. I don't think this is the most important part of the site, but the "new releases" scroll-bar just beneath it is. <br><br>Overall, ths site is:</p><ul>
			<li>image-favoring</li>
			<li>textually utilitarian</li>
			<li>basic</li>
			<li>organized</li>
			<li>interactive</li></ul><p class="main">This website solves the problem of not being able to find a comic book in a comic (or non-comic) book store. The site exists to sell comic books; unsurprisingly, its content is all about comic books. It ranges from big publishers to indie studios. Individual series or products have a short, informal, informative blurb, which I'd expect from a site that favors images. It's really easy to browse the site, made even easier by an ever-present search bar.<br><br>After using this site for a while, I feel like reading my new comics! The site sells comic books and I have bought some of them before because, again, I like comics.
